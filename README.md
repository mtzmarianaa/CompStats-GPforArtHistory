# CompStats-GPforArtHistory

This is a repository for the final project for Computational Statistics (MA 6973, MATH 2080) at NYU with Mike O'Neil. In this project we'll explore the application of GP with different kernels. The input data are SURF descriptors from paintings from Mexican artists. These artists are:
 - Alfredo Ramos Martinez
 - Diego Rivera
 - Frida Kahlo
 - Dr Atl (Gerardo Murillo)
 - Jose Clemente Orozco
 - Leonora Carrington
 - Maria Izquierdo
 - Remedios Varo
 - Rufino Tamayo
 
 This data and idea comes from Mariana Martinez's undegraduate thesis which can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qcijLmFHaO14YUyFAXb8tquHLi15eWBV/view?usp=sharing . An abstract of such work in English can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ME1wgtvle-0SLcirI48rROM7mg99MBmL/view?usp=sharing .
